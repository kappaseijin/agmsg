// address over http is allowed, because two machines on a network you control
// talking over http is ordinary and should not require a tunnel.

// One lifecycle for both drivers, because every way a driver call can fail has
// to end the same way: the promise settles exactly once, and no child outlives
// the call that started it.
//
// Each failure route used to be handled on its own and two of them escaped the
// promise entirely. A write to a driver that has stopped reading takes EPIPE on
// the *stdin stream*, and unparseable output throws inside the 'close' handler;
// an unhandled stream 'error' and a throw from a listener are both raised, not
// returned, so they bypassed the caller and killed the process. They now arrive
// here like any other failure.
//
// Killing on failure is the other half. Rejecting alone leaves the child
// running, which only trades "the process dies" for "the process cannot exit" --
// its handles pin the loop -- and lets failures pile up children as cycles
// retry.
//
// Every failure settles at 'exit' and drops our own ends of the pipes as it
// goes -- including the ordinary one, a driver that simply exits non-zero.
// 'close' waits for every stdio stream to end, and a driver's own grandchild
// inherits those pipes and can hold them open indefinitely; SIGKILL reaches the
// driver but nothing it started. So no failure route may depend on 'close', and
// only success does, because only success has to read all of stdout. What this
// process owns is what it can be sure of releasing, so that is what it releases:
// a grandchild is left to the operator, not chased through the process tree.
// A child's ending, said so that every platform's answer is legible.
//
// `signal ?? code` printed one number and hid which field produced it. On
// Windows/Git Bash a driver that died to a signal arrives through `code` as a
// raw wait status -- one report carried `3840` -- and the operator got a bare
// number with no way to tell it from an ordinary exit status (#782).
//
// Both fields are named, and a `code` outside the range an exit status can take
// is additionally shown DECOMPOSED rather than decoded. Under the POSIX
// encoding 3840 is `WIFEXITED` with status 15, while the report that raised it
// described a signal; nobody reproducing this has the platform to settle which
// layer produced the number. Printing both components lets the operator see
// which one is non-zero. Asserting one of them would put a second wrong
// sentence exactly where the first one was, which is the defect this fixes.

// Hands the driver its input as a FILE rather than down a pipe.
//
// The driver takes that team's registry lock as its first act and holds it for
// the whole call, and every release route it has is a trap. So the parent must
// never end up in a position where it has to kill the driver: SIGKILL runs no
// trap and leaves `.config.lock` with no owner, and every later run for that
// team then waits on a directory nobody will remove. Measured, on one script
// with an EXIT/TERM trap: SIGTERM leaves no lock, SIGKILL leaves it.
//
// Sending SIGTERM instead is NOT the fix, and was measured not to be one.
// Bash defers a trap while it waits on a foreground child, so the driver --
// which is sitting in `node` -- does not run its release until that child ends;
// signalling the process group does work here, but on Windows Node's kill()
// ignores the signal and terminates forcefully whatever it is asked for, which
// is the platform the field report came from.
//
// So the kill is removed instead of being softened. Writing to a pipe was the
// one failure route that reached a LIVE driver: a write whose reader is gone
// raises on the stdin stream, and that arrived at fail() while the lock was
// held. A file cannot fail that way. It is complete before the child exists --
// therefore before the lock exists -- and the child still reads its stdin
// exactly as before, so no driver changes.
//
// ONLY the driver that holds the lock is handed its input this way, and the
// caller says which one that is. The storage driver has no registry lock, so
// nothing about it needs this, and giving it the same treatment would cost it
// two things for nothing: its input -- which after evaluatePull() is decrypted
// message content, on E2EE teams as much as plain ones -- would go to rest on
// disk where only a pipe carried it, and it would lose the bounded failure it
