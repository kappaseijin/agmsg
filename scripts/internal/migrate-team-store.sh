#
# Called when a team connects to a remote, which is the only thing that requires
# the move: a connected team's rows carry ids where a local team's carry names,
# and one column cannot hold both. Teams that never connect stay in the shared
# store, which is what every external reader of the database depends on.
#
# It COPIES. The shared store keeps its rows, so a migration that goes wrong
# costs nothing but disk — delete the per-team store, clear the partition field,
# and the team is back where it was. Reclaiming the copied rows is a separate,
# later decision that wants confidence this one does not.

#
# A hand-written list is what went wrong. It omitted legacy_id -- the column
# that links an event to its row in the legacy messages table (#689) -- so every
# moved message arrived unlinked. That is not a cosmetic loss: the two readers
# that UNION the two tables list it twice, and the legacy projection in
# sqlite-sync, whose entire guard is `events.legacy_id = messages.id`, matches
# nothing and projects the message a SECOND time, which is then pushed to the
# server and on to every other machine (#710). The containment check carried the
# same omission, so both sides compared equal and the migration verified clean
# while dropping the column.
#
# Deriving it means the next column added to events is carried without anyone
# remembering to come here. The destination schema is replayed from this store's
# own sqlite_master further down, so both stores always have exactly this set --

# events.seq/id are copied verbatim by design (renumbering would move every
# cursor), but sqlite_sequence is deliberately excluded from the schema copy
# above (sqlite owns it; the AUTOINCREMENT columns "bring it back on their
# own first insert" per the comment there) -- so the destination's high-water
# becomes MAX(this team's OWN copied seqs), which can sit far below a cursor
# that reflects every team's combined traffic. A new message then receives a
# seq below the cursor and is permanently invisible to storage_list_unread /
# storage_watch_after (delivery_tip is read from sqlite_sequence directly,
# see sqlite.sh's _sqlite_highwater) -- production symptom: history shows the
# read marker, inbox says nothing new, monitor and turn are both silent.
#
# The fix raises the floor, not the cursor: advance the destination's
# sqlite_sequence for 'events' to at least the greatest copied cursor, so the
# NEXT event (assigned floor+1) always sorts above every preserved cursor.
# Not "set cursors to 0" -- that would make every already-read message look
