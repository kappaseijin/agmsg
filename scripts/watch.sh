# Stream new agmsg messages for the current session as they arrive.
#
# Intended to be launched by Claude Code's Monitor tool from the SessionStart
# hook (`session-start.sh`), but also works standalone as `tail -f` for
# inbox: any agent runtime that can read stdout can consume it.
#
# Usage: watch.sh <session_id> <project_path> <agent_type> [active_name]
#
# Behavior:
#   - Resolves (team, agent) pairs for (project_path, agent_type) via
#     identities.sh. By default, subscribes to messages addressed to any
#     of those pairs.
#   - When [active_name] is given, narrows the subscription to every local
#     (team, agent) pair whose runtime and exact agent name match — useful for
#     `actas` exclusive role mode. Without it, the project-scoped subscription
#     remains unchanged.
#   - Inbox and monitor share the driver's persistent per-(team,agent) read
#     cursor. A restart resumes from consumed state, and a fresh watcher delivers
#     existing unread messages instead of jumping over them. See the
#     read-state synchronization specification.
#   - Polls the SQLite DB at AGMSG_WATCH_INTERVAL seconds (default 5, also
#     overridable via the delivery.monitor.poll_interval config key).
#   - Emits one line per new message:
#         <ts> | <team> | <from> → <to> | <body>
#     Newlines in body are escaped to literal "\n" so each message stays a
#     single line — easier for Monitor to deliver as one event.
#   - Writes a pidfile at ~/.agents/agmsg/run/watch.<session_id>.pid and
#     removes it on EXIT / SIGTERM / SIGINT.

# session_id is normally baked into the launch command (CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID /
# GROK_SESSION_ID). An empty first arg is tolerated and resolved below (after the
# libs are sourced) rather than failing hard, so a runtime that cannot bake one
# in — notably Grok Build's `monitor` tool, where "$GROK_SESSION_ID" expands to
# empty — still starts the watcher. A literal `-` is the caller-side sentinel
# for that same no-session-id case. project_path and agent_type are required.
