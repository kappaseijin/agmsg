# Usage:
#   remote.sh connect --endpoint <url> [--e2ee] <team>
#   remote.sh pull --endpoint <url> [--team-id <uuid>] <team>
#   remote.sh unlock <team> --bundle <file> --confirm-digest <sha256>
#   remote.sh unlock <team> --snapshot <file> (--identity <file>|--identity-stdin)
#     [--confirm-digest <sha256>]
#   remote.sh unlock <team> --authenticated-bundle-stdin
#     Read the exact bundle bytes from stdin after the invoking program has
#     authenticated them end to end. remote.sh does not authenticate this input.
#     Use only with an authenticator that verifies integrity and binds the
#     expected team/context. This mode replaces, and must not be combined with,
#     --bundle or --confirm-digest.
#
#     This is not a bypass of the digest check: it switches the authentication
#     authority from a live human digest comparison to an upstream AEAD verifier.
#     remote.sh cannot prove that verifier ran, and does not pretend to — that
#     limit is the caller's contract, not a hidden assumption. Reserved for the
#     disaster-recovery route (see docs/remote-disaster-recovery.md); ordinary
#     onboarding and the courier `fetch` path use --bundle/--confirm-digest.

# Team-scoped cloud/self-hosted sync connection. The OSS CLI never assumes or
# defaults to a server, so <endpoint> is always required. `connect` registers a

# `unlock` confirms the handed authority and starts the background sync engine.

#
# A registry lock left behind by a killed process is never broken by anything:
# nothing expires, nothing sweeps, and acquire waits out its budget and fails
# with `timed out acquiring registry lock`, which describes contention. The
# operator's next move is to look for the process holding it; there is no
# process, and no message anywhere names the directory to remove. A machine in
# that state cannot get itself out.
#
# This REPORTS and removes nothing. The report alone ends "cannot recover":
# it says which team, what the lock records, whether that process is running,
# and prints the removal as a line to paste. Sweeping automatically is a
# separate decision with a worse failure mode — a wrong verdict takes a lock
# away from a process that is using it — and it is not made here.
#
# Not a check, so no `[x]`/`[ ]` and no effect on the exit code: a lock that
# exists is not a failed prerequisite, and a doctor that exits non-zero because
# a team is busy would be wrong every time somebody is joining.
# One lock, reported. Split out so the two ways of finding them — a named team,
# or a sweep — share this body and neither has to feed a loop from a string.
# Joining the paths into one variable and reading it back would mean either an
# unquoted heredoc, which runs command substitution on a team name, or unquoted
# word splitting, which globs one.

  # "" and returns 0, so the cleanup reads as working. Measured on bash 3.2.57

  # within the function. `printf %q` fixes the value at set time and survives a
  # TMPDIR containing spaces.

  # naming the request body. Reordering cannot close it, because there is always
  # a first allocation. So there is exactly one, and everything else is made

# instead of stopping. Two callers, one situation: a retry that already holds a
# binding, and a first attempt whose POST committed but whose response never
# arrived. In both, the REMOTE side is complete — /v1/connect commits the team,
# its opening policy and the whole roster in one transaction — and only local,
# derived state is missing. There is nothing to roll back on either side.
#
# Deliberately absent, and not an oversight: a route that REMOVES a
# registration. This protocol carries no credential — reaching the server is
# the permission, and the trust boundary is the network it sits on. A delete
# route would let anyone who can reach the server destroy a team's registration
# with nothing but a team_id, which is strictly worse than the dead end it
# would be removing. The reason /v1/connect refuses to WRITE to a team that
# already exists is the same reason it must not offer to delete one.
#
# Returns 0 when the binding was written, 1 when the registration is not ours
# or the server could not be read.
# <expected_server_instance> is the server_instance_id the caller already has
# recorded, or empty when it has none. When given it must match EXACTLY: the
# endpoint is an address, not an identity, and the same address can come back
# as a different server. Without the comparison a rebuilt (or substituted)
# server holding a team with the same id, name and roster would have its own
# instance id written over ours, silently re-anchoring the binding. Empty is
# for the path that has nothing to compare -- a POST whose response was lost
# leaves no recorded id, and there the first fetch IS the anchor.

# one pidfile per unit under the connection's run dir, SIGTERM to stop, and
# _agmsg_pid_alive_local to tell a live engine from a stale pidfile.
#
# LOCAL, and that is not a detail. Every pid checked in this file came from `$!`
# in this shell, or was read back from the pidfile this shell wrote it to — and
# a pidfile does not move a number into another pid space. Under Git Bash those
# are MSYS pids, which `tasklist` has no record of, so the non-local probe
# answers "dead" for an engine that is running: the field report in #652, where
# `ps -W` found the process, the pidfile held the same number, and status still
# said stale. The rule is in instance-id.sh and it is about WHERE THE PID WAS
# MINTED, not about whether it arrived through a file. This leaves the
# pidfile lifecycle in two places (here and watch.sh); factoring it into a shared
# lib is intentionally deferred, not overlooked.

#
# The reason for its existence is that the reason was already on disk and
# unread: `event()` writes a `fatal` line into the run log with a timestamp,
# and nothing `status` opens has ever mentioned it. This is a place to read

# removal is the only thing standing between a reversed decision and the
# operator, then a failed removal reports a refusal that is no longer true,

#

# Why a start failure has to be spoken here rather than left to the caller.
#
# This function used to end in `disown … || true`, so it always returned 0, and
# every caller was written around that. `cmd_sync_start` called it as
# `if ! _remote_sync_engine_start …`, where `set -e` is suspended — so a failed
# `echo > "$pidfile"` two lines from the end was stepped over, the function
# reported success, and the command died further down at `cat "$pidfile"` having
# printed nothing of its own. The others did not look at the return value at
# all. Measured with the run dir made unwritable: the caller saw success, then
# exit 1, silent.
#
# Five callers now, and they are deliberately not uniform — the rule is whether
# the engine is what the command was FOR:
#
#   cmd_sync_start    `if ! …`     the engine is the purpose; the command fails
#   cmd_unlock        `|| true`    same, but its own readiness handler converts
#                                  the empty pid into unlock's failure, and the
#                                  refusal is already on stderr by then
#   cmd_pull          capture      purpose already served; reports
#   cmd_connect       capture      purpose already served; reports
#   cmd_set_endpoint  capture      purpose already served; reports
#
# Derive the set before trusting it: `grep -n '_remote_sync_engine_start "'`.
# set-endpoint arrived while this change was in review, as a bare call, and the
# rebase that brought it did not conflict.
#
# The tolerant `mkdir … || true` was half of it. Tolerating the directory and
# then writing into it unguarded moves the failure to a line that cannot
# explain itself. Both halves are checked below, and the writability of the
# pidfile is proven BEFORE the engine is spawned — a spawn whose pidfile cannot

# could not be acquired, or its file exists but is not parseable JSON) --
# a FAILURE distinct from "never connected", because a caller enumerating
# every locally-known team (e.g. deciding what to back up) must not treat a
# team it failed to read as identical to one that was genuinely never bound.
#
# Strict, machine-consumed ABI (ADR 0007 addendum): a cloud/self-hosted
# driver correlates this against its own operation-status record to decide
# whether a given connect attempt is the one that actually committed, or a
# stale retry against an already-superseded binding — so the field set and
# "null on unknown" contract are load-bearing, not just a debugging aid.

#
# Reads config.json exactly ONCE (delta review, ported from
# feat/remote-connect-onboarding) — six independent
# `_remote_read_config_field` calls would each independently re-open the
# file from disk; a concurrent disconnect/reconnect/force-rebind's atomic
# rename could swap in a new version in between any two of those six reads,
# so the assembled object could mix fields from two different on-disk
# versions that never actually coexisted at any instant — a real defect for
# a strict ABI another process correlates fields against (unlike the
# human-text status path above, which is read for a person to glance at and
# where this same multi-read shape is only cosmetically stale, not a spec
# violation). Also acquired under the team's own write lock, so the single
# read can't land mid-write either. All fields are derived from that one
# in-memory snapshot by a single python parse — not hand-rolled string
# concatenation, since this is a strict schema a driver parses and a value

  # The lock exists to serialise "is one running, and if not, start one". Both
  # halves are over by this line: the pidfile names a live engine, so a second
  # `sync start` that takes this lock now reads `running` from
  # `_remote_sync_engine_status` -- which asks the pidfile, the pid's liveness
  # and its cmdline, and never asks about readiness -- and returns
  # "already running" without starting anything. Nothing below needs exclusion:
  # the loop only reads status and tails a log.
  #
  # WHAT THE FIELD REPORT ACTUALLY WAS, in the order it happened.
  #
  # The engine emits the capabilities marker BEFORE it asks for this lock, so the
  # ordinary sequence is: marker, this loop sees it, release, then `roster
  # prepare` takes the lock. That order was never the problem, and an earlier
  # version of this comment said it was.
  #
  # On the reporting machine the loop never reached the marker check at all.
  # `_remote_sync_engine_status` answered `stale` for a pid this shell had just
  # started -- the non-local probe cannot see it on Windows (#652) -- so
  # `engine_state = running` was false and the condition short-circuited before
  # the marker was ever read. The loop then ran to its ceiling, which is counted
  # in ITERATIONS and not in time (#779), and on that host 1600 turns of four
  # spawned processes each is not sixteen seconds. The lock was held for all of
  # it, and every other operation for that team waited on a directory that was
  # not going to be removed.
  #
  # #812 removed the direct cause: the status probe is local now. This release is
  # not a second fix for that. It is a separate contract -- the lock covers
  # deciding whether to start and starting, and nothing after -- so that a marker
  # that is late or missing for ANY reason costs this caller its own wait and
  # not the rest of the machine.
