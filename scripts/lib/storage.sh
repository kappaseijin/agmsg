# storage-driver interface; it just centralizes the path resolution that was
# previously duplicated across the script set.
#
# Resolution order:
#   1. AGMSG_STORAGE_PATH — directory that holds messages.db (env override)
#   2. SKILL_DIR env var  — set by callers before sourcing (sandbox fallback)
#   3. BASH_SOURCE[0]     — derive from this file's own path (standard case)
#

# and the built-in default once the storage-driver work lands; the intended
# full order is env > config > default. Keep that logic here so call sites
# stay unchanged.

# agmsg_db_path turns the team selector into a path segment, so it cannot do its
# job without the shared name validator. Sourced here rather than left to each
# caller: watch.sh already reached the store without validate.sh in scope, and a
# caller that forgets it would build an unchecked path rather than fail.
# validate.sh guards against double-sourcing, so a caller that sources it too is
# unaffected. If neither locator resolves, the validator is simply absent and
# agmsg_db_path fails on the call — never silently unvalidated.

# concurrent writers still serialize; with the default busy_timeout=0 a leader
# fanning a job out to N members would lose all but one write — and silently,
# since the failed sends just exit non-zero. All DB-backed call sites go through
# this wrapper. In-memory JSON parsing (`sqlite3 :memory:`) does not need it —
# it has no file lock to contend for. Override the timeout via
# $AGMSG_BUSY_TIMEOUT (milliseconds). See #114.
#
# Uses the `.timeout` dot-command rather than `PRAGMA busy_timeout=N`: the

# inbox/check-inbox/history and the monitor watch stream (#102), the same
# sqlite3 >= 3.50 escaping behaviour behind #143. `-escape off` restores the
