# See docs/spec/ref/stage-1-remote-sync.md. All bulk input/output is JSONL.

# Exit 13 is this driver's "a check failed", and it was the ONLY thing a caller
# received: 113 sites across 13 functions returned it with nothing on stderr, so
# `storage sync reprocess failed (exit 13)` named no check and no line. Working
# out which one had fired meant reading the whole file against the failing
# machine's state.
#
# The location is derived, not written. A hand-written reason per site is one
# more sentence that can drift from the condition beside it -- the same drift
# #781 removed by folding an authority-file fault and its wording into one
# function. FUNCNAME/BASH_LINENO cannot disagree with where the return actually
# is, because the shell computes them from it.
#
# stderr because remote-sync.mjs already prefers it: `stderr.trim() || "driver
# returned a non-zero exit without diagnostics"`. Nothing above needs changing
# for this to surface -- and that fallback message is now what it always meant,
# "the driver said nothing", rather than the only thing it could ever say.
#
# Callers keep their own `return`. A function cannot return on behalf of the one
# that called it, so this only reports; replacing a bare return with a call to
# this would let execution fall through and change control flow.

# `jq -b` IS REQUIRED HERE, AND THE REQUIREMENT FAILS CLOSED (#829).
#
# A native Windows jq opens stdout in text mode, so every line it prints ends
# CRLF. Two values this driver sends ride out of a final-stage `jq … | @tsv`
# read by `while IFS=$'\t' read -r`: `read` consumes the LF, `IFS` has no CR,
# so the CR sticks to the LAST field -- the message `wire_id` and the base64
# envelope `blob`. The server then answers HTTP 400. Measured on the reporting
# machine: `hex(wire_id)` and `hex(blob)` both end `0D`, and stripping that byte
# and resending produces `push.ack … stored`.
#
# `-b` is jq's own answer to this and the manual names this exact case. It is
# the short form on purpose: `--binary` is rejected by jq-1.7.1-apple (measured:
# rc 2, same as an unknown option), while `-b` is accepted there and on the
# reporting machine's jq 1.8.2.
#
# REFUSING IS THE POINT. This repository checks that jq EXISTS and never that it
# is a particular version -- `doctor` does not look at jq at all -- so there is
# no floor to lean on. A jq without `-b` would exit 2 on every call, which is a
# failure either way; saying so by name here is the difference between "the sync
# is broken" and "this jq cannot do binary output". Falling back to stripping CR
# afterwards is deliberately NOT offered: it guesses at which CRs were added,
# and the guess is wrong for any value that legitimately ends a line with one.

# Said every time it refuses, not only the first time (#829, raised in review).

  # sentinel fixes that half; the other half is that a jq can print the right
  # bytes and still fail, and through a process substitution that status is
  # unreachable (both raised in review).
  #
  # The first attempt at getting both wrote jq's output to
  # `${TMPDIR}/agmsg-jq-probe.$$` and took the status from the pipeline. `$$` is
  # the PARENT's pid inside a subshell, so concurrent sealers in one process tree
  # shared that path: one removed it while another was still reading, and the

  # This is the same reasoning about `$$` that was wrong once already (#804).

  # sentinel; `&&` appends a second line only if jq exited 0. Two `read`s, no

# Legacy rows live in `messages`, which predates the event log and which nothing
# writes any more. The push candidate query reads `events` only, so a team whose
# history is entirely legacy would connect and upload nothing -- silently, since
# an empty page is a normal answer. This projects those rows into the event log
# once, per team, at the moment that team first prepares a push.
#
# The synthesized seq is `id - _AGMSG_LEGACY_SEQ_OFFSET`, which is negative and
# therefore below every existing position. That single choice satisfies all
# three things the position has to be at once:
#
#   collision-free  existing seq values are the positive AUTOINCREMENT space
#   stable          it is a pure function of the legacy row id, so a re-run
#                   reproduces it and the wire id reserved against it in
#                   sync_messages stays valid
#   ordered         legacy ids ascend, so the projected history sorts ahead of
#                   every event that already exists -- chronologically correct
#
# It also leaves read state alone. `read_cursors.local_position` holds positive
# values and the unread query asks for `seq > cursor`, so projected rows are
# below every cursor and stay delivered, which is what the phase-3 adoption
# already decided about them.
#
# Explicit negative rowids do not disturb AUTOINCREMENT: sqlite_sequence keeps
# the high-water it had, so the delivery tip (which reads it) is unaffected.

    -- (push_cursor, e.seq]. That inner test named e.seq, so it was correlated:
    -- one scan of the gap set per candidate, and the work grew with the SQUARE
    -- of the number of candidates. On a first connect, where every message is a
    -- candidate, that is the whole history squared (#912).

    -- The gap set does not depend on e. The FIRST gap after the cursor bounds
    -- every contiguous run that starts there, so the answer is the largest

  # ONE jq FOR THE WHOLE PAGE, AND NO eval AT ALL (#908 item 3, #940).
  #
  # Each message used to pay a printf and a jq, and the jq's output was a list
  # of shell assignments fed to eval -- which is why every field had to travel
  # through `tostring | @sh` (#930): the only thing standing between a
  # server-chosen string and the shell was quoting discipline. Both costs go
  # together. The page is parsed by a single jq that emits, after a leading
  # record count, every record's eighteen fields as raw values separated by
  # NUL bytes; the loop below reads them with `read -d ''` into plain
  # variables. Nothing server-chosen is ever parsed as shell again -- the
  # class #930 had to defend is gone, not guarded.
  #
  # The framing is sound because a NUL can never appear inside a value: jq
  # refuses any record whose field contains U+0000, naming the record and the
  # field (#940 -- the old pipeline silently stored such a body MANGLED, the
  # NUL becoming other bytes on the way through `jq -r` and the shell's own
  # NUL-stripping, and reported success; a value the store cannot hold
  # verbatim is refused now, not rewritten).
  #
  # --raw-input keeps the old "one JSON value per line" refusal: each line is
  # fromjson'd on its own, so a line smuggling two values fails exactly as it
  # did when the per-line jq slurped it (the error names the line). `-s` holds
  # the page in jq's memory once -- the same order of memory the old
  # per-message `-s` peaked at for its largest message, page-wide, and a page
  # is bounded at 1000 records.
