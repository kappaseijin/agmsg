# sqlite storage driver (built-in, default).
#
# Implements the storage contract (docs/spec/driver-interface.md §2, ADR 0003)
# over SQLite. Sourced by the storage facade (lib/storage.sh, agmsg_storage_load),
# so agmsg_db_path / agmsg_sqlite / agmsg_sql_readfile_path from storage.sh are in
# scope. State is an append-only `events` log (canonical JSONL: message_sent /
# message_read). The legacy `messages` table is read **read-only** and UNIONed
# into list_unread / history so an existing store keeps its inbox and history
# after #206 switches call sites onto the contract (§2.4); legacy rows are never
# migrated or mutated here.
#
# Framing (§1.4 / ADR 0003): record-returning ops write data only to stdout and
# fail with a non-zero exit; control ops (check/init/mark_read_batch/compact)
# print a §1.4 status name on stdout. The delivery cursor (§2.2) is the events.seq
# autoincrement, returned as an opaque decimal string. Read-marking is
# recipient-scoped ((team, agent)) and idempotent.

# <team> is the storage selector (see agmsg_db_path). Passed explicitly rather
# than held in a driver-wide variable: these run inside command substitutions,
# where an assignment made by a caller would not be visible anyway.
_sqlite_db() { agmsg_db_path "$1"; }
# The quote is a variable, not a \' in the pattern: bash 3.2 keeps the
# backslash of a \' REPLACEMENT and would double a quote into \'\' there while
# producing '' on bash 4+. tests/test_sqlpath.bats holds this equal to the
# forking form it replaces, on the inputs that matter to SQL quoting.
_sqlite_lit() { local q="'"; printf '%s' "${1//$q/$q$q}"; }

# Run a record-returning query: strip CR but PRESERVE the sqlite exit status
# (pipefail), so a backend failure surfaces as a non-zero return instead of
# being swallowed by tr's exit 0. The backend's error text goes to stderr (a
# separate fd — it never pollutes the JSONL on stdout) so failures are
# debuggable, per §2.1 framing (#203 (1) / review).
# LC_ALL=C on the tr: message bodies are arbitrary user/agent text and can
# contain byte sequences that are not valid UTF-8. Under a UTF-8 locale, BSD
# tr (macOS) treats -d's argument set as characters and aborts with "tr:
# Illegal byte sequence" the moment such a body passes through, taking the
# whole query down with it (observed live: agmsg-watch-stream.sh looping on
# "warning: agmsg history failed" once a single malformed message entered the
# store). LC_ALL=C makes tr operate byte-wise instead, which is what -d '\r'
# actually wants here. Same fix already used elsewhere in this codebase for
# the identical failure mode (guards/gh-write-owner-guard.sh,
# guards/git-push-owner-guard.sh, lib/registry-lock.sh).

  ( set -o pipefail; agmsg_sqlite "$(_sqlite_db "$1")" "$2" | LC_ALL=C tr -d '\r' )

# The same query, handed over stdin instead of on the command line (#882).
#
# FOR SQL WHOSE LENGTH GROWS WITH THE DATA, and only for that. A command line
# has an operating-system limit and stdin does not, so any statement carrying a
# list of ids -- one `IN (...)` entry per pulled message, per acked message, per
# roster member -- has to arrive this way or it stops working at a size nobody
# chose.
#
# The size that stops it is not large. Windows' CreateProcess caps the command
# line at 32,767 characters; measured on a Windows machine, sqlite3 took 827
# uuids as arguments and refused 837. A pull page carrying its ids twice
# reaches that at about 400 messages, which is under half a default page, so a
# team that had grown past it simply could not be pulled -- the failure the
# report in #882 arrived as.
#
# `-batch` because this is a script rather than a session: without it sqlite3
# reading a non-tty is still willing to treat a malformed line as an
# interactive prompt, and the point of this path is that nobody is watching.

# --- contract: messages ----------------------------------------------------

# The one place a message becomes rows. Every caller that records a
# message_sent goes through this, including the one that lands messages pulled
# from a remote -- mirroring only what this machine sends would leave a reader
# of the legacy table able to see half a conversation, and the half it could not
# see is the one that made this worth doing (#689).
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER. Worth stating where the code is, because "we write
# to the legacy table" invites the reading that any external viewer will keep
# working, and three kinds of store are outside it:
#
#   * A team on the jsonl driver has no legacy table to mirror into -- that
#     table is created here and in internal/init-db.sh and nowhere else. Such a
#     team is invisible to those readers and this cannot change that. Measured,
#     not assumed: the jsonl driver's only `messages` references are a field of
#     the sync pull payload.
#   * A team moved to its own store (drivers.partition=per-team) writes to a
#     different file. A viewer pointed at the shared store sees nothing for it,
#     mirrored or not.
#   * Rows that predate this are unmirrored in the other direction -- they exist
#     only in the legacy table -- which is what the UNION in list_unread and
#     history is still for.
#
# WHEN IT ENDS. Not on a date, and not "once everyone upgrades": the readers are
# other people's software and we cannot enumerate them. It ends when someone can
# show that nothing reads the table any more, and until someone does that work
# this is a supported interface rather than a migration step. Written down
# because an unbounded compatibility write with no stated exit becomes permanent
# by default, and then nobody knows whether it is load-bearing.
#
# Both tables in one transaction, and the legacy rowid recorded on the event.
# The correspondence is not bookkeeping: it is what every reader that unions the
# two tables uses to recognise one message rather than list it twice.
