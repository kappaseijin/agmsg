# A review of #696: the fix above feeds MAX(local_position) straight into
# sqlite_sequence.seq, an AUTOINCREMENT-authority column -- not a data column
# like the ones the re-entry guard above already protects. SQLite ranks TEXT
# above every INTEGER in its default comparison, so a single non-integer
# cursor among this team's rows can make MAX() pick the damaged value over
# any real one, corrupting how every future seq gets assigned on this store
# -- not merely carrying a bad value forward unread the way the OLD (pre-#695)
# first-time path already could.
#
# The existing "not an integer is refused" test above covers RE-ENTRY only
# (it migrates alpha successfully first, then corrupts the DESTINATION to
# test _missing_from_dest). This is the gap named: the FIRST-TIME path
# never validated source cursor types at all before this fix started writing
# them into sqlite_sequence. Reproduced by corrupting the SHARED cursor
# BEFORE ever migrating, so the very first attempt is what has to refuse.
